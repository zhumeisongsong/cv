## Engineering Experience

### Software Engineer @[Atrae](https://atrae.co.jp/) _(2021.12 ~ · 3 yrs+)_

React/Next.js/TailwindCSS/Jotai/Valtio/Immer/Urql/Nx Monorepo/TypeScript/NestJS/NodeJS/GraphQL/Restful API/Axios/Docker/AWS/GitHub Actions

- Led the front-end migration from a monolithic app to Nx monorepo, enabling the independent development and deployment of multiple products.
- By separating the Domain and Application layers from the Presenter, the issue of an overly heavy Presenter was addressed. This made the scope of changes more manageable and significantly reduced the number of mock methods required during testing.
- Manually implemented a Dependency Injection (DI) framework in React, achieving complete separation between interface definitions and implementations. This improved the decoupling and flexibility of the modules.
- Limited the use of React to the Interface-Adapter layer and UI layer, reducing the system's dependency on React and specific state management libraries.
- Refactored and migrated the survey answer application, which has over 500,000 monthly visits, to a Monorepo. The modular design supports independent development and debugging of different components of the application, improving development efficiency and future maintainability. By implementing on-demand loading of components, the page's First Contentful Paint (FCP) was improved by 50% (from 1.8 seconds to 0.9 seconds).
- Used semantic-release for version management of both internal private packages and shared open-source packages, implementing semantic versioning and automating the release process.
- Collaborated with back-end engineers to implement a unified front-end and back-end error-handling design through a shared package (including input validation and error handling). Provided a documented error-handling solution based on Error Codes.
- Adopted a GraphQL Federation architecture in a new project, designing subgraphs based on aggregate roots, successfully avoiding circular dependency issues.
- Developed GraphQL-based findAllWorkflowActions and findAllWorkflowTemplates APIs using NestJS, optimizing the performance of these queries.
- Used Persisted Queries to reduce request size, decreasing bandwidth consumption and eliminating the performance overhead of having the server parse and validate query content on every request.
- Applied Gzip compression to large JS files exceeding 10 MB, significantly reducing initial page load time.
- Collaborated with designers to develop and maintain a reusable UI component library based on Material UI (including components such as LoadingButton, Steps, Rate, Spin, Selectable Table, etc.), enhancing team development efficiency and code consistency.

### Front-End Lead @[Monstarlab Japan](https://monstar-lab.com/jp) _(2018.12 ~ 2021.11 · 3 yrs)_

React/Redux/Redux-Saga/Immer/Sass/styled-components/axios/Docker/AWS/GitHub Actions

- Collaborated with frontend engineers across different branches of the organization to promote React best practices internally.
- In a coffee label printing web project, optimized the performance of displaying a list of over 5,000 label images by using a virtual list, resolving page lag issues.
- Designed and developed a live-stream comment feature capable of handling over 100,000 concurrent users. Ensured the safety of counting concurrent comments by utilizing atomic counters. Employed throttling to control comment refresh frequency and maintain performance. Used Python scripts to simulate a high volume of concurrent requests and tested the feature’s ability to handle 100,000 simultaneous users.
- Led the development and maintenance of components for the design system in a large-scale stock trading web project.
- Trained junior engineers and through code reviews to improve code quality and knowledge transfer.
