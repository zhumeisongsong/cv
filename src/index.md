## 🎨 Goals and Vision

As a software engineer, my goals are:

- Addressing `technical debt`, build robust systems that are easy to modify and extend
- Improving `development quality`, deliver high-quality products that meet user needs
- Enhancing `team collaboration efficiency`, foster a positive and collaborative team culture

The approach to achieving these goals could be:

- Selecting a `worthy challenge` (aimed at creating value)
- Complicating `simple matters` in thought (managing risks and preparing for the future)
- Simplifying `complex matters` in action (delivering quality products while controlling costs)
- Articulating `complexity in a simple manner` (ensuring successful knowledge transfer)

Always try best to making things simple, fight for not be a slave to formal methods.💪

## 🎯 Target Company and Position

I am looking for a company that:

- Is willing to invest in `addressing technical debt` and recognizes its contribution to business growth.
- Values `technological innovation`, but doesn't use technology for the sake of using it.
- Has high standards for `development quality`, not just satisfied with code that runs.
- Focuses more on ensuring that `everyone takes responsibility for the final product outcome`, rather than simply following a specification to complete development.

I am targeting the following position:

- Full-Stack Engineer / Software Engineer
- Front-End Tech Lead / Senior Front-end Engineer
