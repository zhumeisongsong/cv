## 🌱 Brief Introduction

I began self-learning web development technologies during college, and after graduation, I worked as a landscape architect. However, I also pursued my passion for web development through side projects, creating websites for various companies.

In October 2014, I joined Monstarlab Chengdu as a full-time web developer. There, I taught myself React and introduced the front-end and back-end separation architecture, significantly improving team efficiency and system scalability.

By March 2016, I was promoted to Front-End Tech Lead, where I took responsibility for enhancing the front-end quality across all company projects. My efforts focused on improving code quality, doing technical investigations for new projects, and implementing best practices that improved the overall development process.

In December 2018, I moved to Japan and continued my career at Monstarlab Japan, where I further expanded my skills in an international setting.

In December 2021, I joined Atrae as a Software Engineer on the Wevox product team. In this role, I not only focused on front-end development but also participated in all stages of the product development cycle—from gathering user requirements to product design and system development.
