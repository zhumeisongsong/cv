# Target Company and Position

## Target Company

- Product company, not outsourcing company.
- Has willing to invest in resolving technical debt and recognizes its contribution to business growth.
- Values technological innovation, but doesn't use technology for the sake of using it.
- Has requirements for development quality, not just satisfied with code that runs.

## Target Position

- Full-Stack Engineer / Software Engineer
- Front-End Tech Lead / Senior Front-end Engineer

## Engineer Work

- No need to support IE 11
- Could focus more on ensuring that I take responsibility for the final product outcome, rather than simply following a specification to complete development
- Need to add test code: unit test / e2e test
- Have standards for code review


## Team Work

- Not water fall development way, like designer decides everything, engineer only needs to finish what designer design by following specifications.
- Prepare before the meeting, not do the prepare during the meeting.
- Not decide deadline first, then discuss how to complete the task.
